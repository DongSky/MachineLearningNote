## Abstract

Video super-resolution remains a challenging problem despite being a very active area of research.

虽然很火，但是视频超分辨率问题仍然很有挑战性。

Even with huge strides made with single-image super-resolution, multiframe techniques, which utilize multiple frames in improving the quality of a given frame, have yet to fully take advantage of the power of deep learning.
We propose a HR for multi-frame super-resolution that outputs a higher resolution version of a given frame using pixel information from adjacent frames in the video.
Unlike traditional multiframe techniques, our proposed method has minimal data pre-processing and computation cost.
Using both still image and video training data we explore different network architectures and hyperparameter combinations for both the single and multi-frame model that give the best results.
Testing our solution and comparing to recently developed techniques, we observe promising results.
